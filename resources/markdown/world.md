# PHP×

PHP× is a small group of PHP and Laravel meetups around the world. We're a small group now,
but hope to grow over the coming months!

As of right now, this page serves as a scratchpad for meetup organizers. If you would like
to start a PHP× meetup, [get in touch with Chris Morrell](https://bsky.app/profile/cmorrell.com)
and he'll add you to the network (we can host your site or link out to an existing site).

If you would like to contribute to this document, [pull requests are welcome](https://github.com/phpx-foundation/website/blob/main/resources/views/rsvp.blade.php).
Not sure? [Join the PHP× Discord](https://discord.gg/wMy6Eeuwbu) first to discuss!

## The PHP× site

This site is a basic multi-tenant Laravel app. As of November 13, 2024, the following
features were loosely supported:

- Creating groups
- Creating and RSVPing to meetups
- Connecting to individual [Mailcoach](https://www.mailcoach.app/) instances to send group announcements
- Connecting to a Bluesky account to post meetups (partially)

Next steps for the site:

- Adding an admin UI (right now all admin is done via artisan commands)
- Adding more per-group customizations (like theme/etc)
- Improving the announcement integrations

If any of that sounds interesting, [join the Discord](https://discord.gg/wMy6Eeuwbu)! You're welcome
to PR changes, but it's best to talk it thru with group organizers first.

## Resources for Organizers

Another big goal is to make it easier to organize meetups! We'd like to gather resources
so that each person isn't in it alone. Some ideas:

- Guides on having your first meeting
- Companies that are interested in sponsoring meetups
- Tips on estimating how much food/drinks/etc you'll need
- How to get speakers, and what kinds of meetings work well

Hopefully this list will grow over the coming weeks. Keep an eye out.

## What's Next

PHP× started with with [Joe Tannenbaum](https://bsky.app/profile/joe.codes) and 
[PHP×NYC](https://phpxnyc.com/). [Chris Morrell](https://bsky.app/profile/cmorrell.com) 
launched [PHP×Philly](https://phpxphilly.com/) soon after, but in mid-November 2024, 
PHP meetups really started to explode.

We're in the **very** early days of figuring out what this group can do!

Stay tuned.
